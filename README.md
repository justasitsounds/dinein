## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites on your development machine.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:

```
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

## Running the Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

The site application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
                            

The site is developed using the [MeanJs Yeoman generator](http://meanjs.org/generator.html) which will generate the latest stable copy of the MEAN.JS boilerplate and supplies multiple sub-generators to ease your daily development cycles.
